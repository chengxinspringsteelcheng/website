## What is Spring Steel
What is Spring Steel?

Spring steel is required where the final application has the property of reacting to loading by elastic deformation. So materials with high
elasticity are necessary. Spring materials should have the highest tensile strength and a high elastic limit.

In addition to high strain properties in the elastic region, there must also be sufficient plasticity. This allows for the manufacture of cold
formed applications which will not break when they experience unforeseen overloading.

In addition, a high fatigue limit is required which is however not a characteristic value of the material as is, for example, the tensile
strength. For a high fatigue strength, a high degree of purity, a homogenous structure and a smooth carbon-free surface are needed.

These requirements are generally fulfilled very well by steel-based alloys, and hence most applications can be made of steel based alloys,
such as 500CrV4 and SAE10xx. However sometimes there will be additional the requirement for corrosion resistance, heat resistance or
anti-magnetic properties where special materials will be required.

An important property of spring material is Young’s Modulus (E). From this material constant is derived a linear relationship between load
and deflection. The ‘E’ of steel is practically not affected by heat treatment, but it is temperature dependent and this must be taken into
consideration at higher working temperatures.

## Spring Steel Grades

### Mn65, SAE1070, CK67, C60, AISI 1070, 1.1231
widely used in metallurgical, mechanical, electrical construction field, ships, military uses and automobile products. Can be hardened to RWC of 45 easily but cannot reach the hardness of 50CrV4, which can easily be hardened to over RWC of 55.

### 50Cr4V, SAE 6150, 1.8159, EN47
 A similar alloy to 5150 with a small, but effective and essential, vanadium addition. This alloy Spring Steel  is used across a wide variety of applications requiring high tensile strength and toughness, it very popular in automotive engineering and gear and engine construction, such leaf springs, steering knuckles, connecting rods, spindles, intermediate gears, pump and gear shafts. It is an an essential requirement in conical disc springs as well, especially in the Group 3 - Reduced Thickness Disc Springs where contact surfaces and annuli are used. These form critical components on  mining head gear, rope handling systems, spring stacks for furnace crucibles etc.
  
### Nickel and Cobalt alloys
Because of the material composition they have outstanding corrosion resistance to most harsh environments. All these alloys are very expensive and often hard to work, and as a rule have long
deliveries. So please plan for this.

### NiCr 15 Fe 7 TiAl (Inconel X 750) (2.4669) and NiCr19 NbMo (Inconel 718) (2.4668):
These nickel-chrome alloys are practically cobalt-free, and are therefore used in reactor and furnace applications. The hardening process is diff cult and expensive. NIMONIC and INCONEL are trade names.
